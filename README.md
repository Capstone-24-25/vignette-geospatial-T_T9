# Analyzing Travel Mode Choices in California Using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)

## Overview

This project explores the spatial relationship between **population density** and **travel mode choices** (e.g., walking, biking, driving alone) across California counties. By employing **Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)**, the study reveals how these relationships vary regionally, offering nuanced insights into local dynamics that static models may overlook.

---

## Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Assess the influence of **population density** on travel mode choices in California.
- **Specific Aims**:
  1. Identify spatial nonstationarity in the relationship between population density and travel modes.
  2. Pinpoint regions where population density has the most significant effects on choices like walking or biking.
  3. Provide a practical framework for using GWR in similar research contexts.

## Methodology

This project serves as both a tutorial and a research case study, with the following components:
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Travel behavior data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS).
   - Spatial shapefiles of California county boundaries.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning and preparation to ensure compatibility with GWR methodologies.
3. **Geographically Weighted Regression**:
   - Analysis of regional variations to model localized relationships.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Intuitive spatial representations using heatmaps and regression plots.

## Why Geographically Weighted Regression?

Traditional regression models often assume uniform relationships across all regions, potentially missing critical local variations. **GWR** addresses this by incorporating spatial context, enabling a more nuanced understanding of regional dynamics. For example:
- High population density might encourage biking in urban areas like Los Angeles while discouraging it in suburban counties.
- Walking is likely to increase in areas with dense local services but may decline in more remote locations.

**Key Insight**: GWR captures these subtleties, empowering policymakers to develop tailored strategies for transportation planning.

## Results Highlights

1. **Regional Insights**:
   - Areas with high population density, such as the Bay Area, show a strong preference for walking and biking.
   - Low-density regions favor driving alone, underscoring the urban-rural divide in travel behaviors.

2. **Model Performance**:
   - GWR demonstrates superior performance over standard regression models by accounting for spatial variability and providing actionable, localized insights.
