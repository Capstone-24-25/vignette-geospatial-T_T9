# Vignette abstract

The goal of the vignette is analyze how population density influences travel mode choices, such as walking, biking, and driving alone, using travelling and population density data of counties in California. (Data source: ) We demonstrated how to use Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to explore the spatial variation in the relationship between population density and travel mode choices. Determine how the impact of population density on travel modes varies across regions.
